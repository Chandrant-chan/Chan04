    <div class=" container pt-5  bg-success border border-success">Youtube Career:<br><br>Donaldson uploaded his first YouTube video in February 2012, at the age of 13, under the handle "MrBeast6000"; his early content ranged from Let's Plays (mainly focused on Minecraft and Call of Duty: Black Ops II),videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers,videos that offered tips to upcoming YouTube creators, and commentary on YouTube drama. Donaldson appeared only infrequently in these videos.In July 2013, the subscriber count of his channel, then named "That-dude", was around 240.

      In 2015 and 2016, Donaldson began to gain popularity with his "Worst intros on YouTube" series poking fun at YouTube video introductions.By mid-2016, Donaldson had around 30,000 subscribers. In fall 2016, Donaldson dropped out of East Carolina University to pursue a full-time career as a YouTuber.His mother did not approve of this and made him move out of the family home.
      
      As his channel grew, Donaldson hired four childhood friends Chris Tyson, Chandler Hallow, Garrett Ronalds, and Jake Franklin to contribute to his channel.They then contacted numerous YouTubers in order to obtain statistics of their successful videos and predicting the platform's recommendation system.Franklin left the crew in 2020; afterwards, Karl Jacobs, previously a cameraman, was promoted to take his place.</div>
